Please note that if you dont have Python extension in VSCode:

1. Open VS Code, click on the Extensions icon (or press Ctrl+Shift+X), then search for "Python" and click Install on the Microsoft Python extension.
2. After installation, make sure to set your Python interpreter by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P, typing Python: Select Interpreter, and choosing the appropriate Python version.

Otherwise, you can also run this code in Jupyter notebook by uploading the files to the Home folder under the local server. 
The video of demonstration of step by step running VScode for the GUI application has been given already.
